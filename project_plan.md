# Project Plan - Clustering Zillow Project

<h3> Goals</h3>

 - Deliver a final notebook that shows the key drivers behind log error
 - Give a succinct 5 min presenation that covers the exploration, modeling, & takeaways 
 - Use clustering to identify what groups of features are the strongest drivers of log error
 - Have MVP by Monday morning

- <b><font color="red"> Friday</font></b>
    - Complete any unfinished tasks from Thursday if still left opened
    - Review completed exploration exercises and indentify what was useful and can be replicated
    - Discuss and create new features that can be explored
    - Begin clustering
        - Explore each cluster to come up with a label/identify each cluster
            - Evaluate which cluster has the most significant log errors through exploration and statistical testing
    - Feature engineer and Model on new cluster dataframes

- <b><font color="red"> Saturday</font></b>
    - Complete any unfinished tasks from Friday if still left open
    - Continue explore and model analysis
    - Closing in on MVP
    - Use regression models to help determine target (logerror)

    - If time available, rehearse between 9 & 10 a.m.
    - Give presenation!


<h3>Acquire</h3>
   - Create SQL query 
   - Once pulled, use .csv to load for faster performance

<h3>Prepare</h3>
   - Compare clean_zillow functions
   - Discuss outliers and how to handle
   - Finalize prepare.py with cleaning completed

<h3>Explore-Model-Evaluate</h3>

- Review completed exploration exercises and indentify what was useful and can be replicated
- Discuss and create new features that can be explored
- Begin clustering
    - Explore each cluster to come up with a label/identify each cluster
    - Evaluate which cluster has the most significant log errors through exploration and statistical testing
    - Feature engineer and Model on new cluster dataframes
- Use regression models to help determine target (logerror)


<h3>Presentation Practice</h3>

   - Create draft of talking points
   - Don't get stuck in the weeds, stay high level
   - Focus on Exploration, Clustering, Modeling, Takeaways
   - Practice 4 times
       - 1st time no timer
       - Record each other presenting
       - Keep practicing until it feels natural

<h3>Deliverables</h3>

- A clearly named final notebook. This notebook will be what you present and should contain plenty of markdown documentation and cleaned up code.
- A README that explains what the project is, how to reproduce you work, and your notes from project planning.
- A Python module or modules that automate the data acquisistion and preparation process. These modules should be imported and used in your final notebook.
